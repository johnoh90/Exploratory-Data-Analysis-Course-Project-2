#Introduction

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence that it is harmful to human health. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM2.5. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). You can read more information about the NEI at the EPA National Emissions Inventory web site.

For each year and for each type of PM source, the NEI records how many tons of PM2.5 were emitted from that source over the course of the entire year. The data that you will use for this assignment are for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

##Assignment
The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999–2008. You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.

##Preparation - Download the data

First, download the assignments files within your working directory.

```{r}
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")
```

##Questions

You must address the following questions and tasks in your exploratory analysis. For each question/task you will need to make a single plot. Unless specified, you can use any plotting system in R to make your plot.

#####1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

First, aggregate by year (1999, 2002, 2005, 2008).
```{r}
total <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year, NEI, sum)
```

Then plot the bar plot:
```{r}
barplot((total$Emissions)/10^6, names.arg=total$year, xlab = "Year", ylab = "PM2.5 Emissions", main = "PM2.5 Emissions From US Sources")
```

From this bar chart, we can see that PM2.5 emissions have decreased from 1999 to 2008.

#####2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟸𝟺𝟻𝟷𝟶") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

First, take a subset of Baltimore:
```{r}
baltimore <- subset(NEI, fips == "24510")
totalbaltimore <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year, baltimore, sum)
```

Then plot the bar plot:
```{r}
barplot(totalbaltimore$Emissions, names.arg=totalbaltimore$year, xlab = "Year", ylab = "Baltimore PM2.5 Emissions", main = "PM2.5 Emissions From Baltimore")
```

Overall, the PM2.5 emissions have decreased in Baltimore from 1999 to 2008.

#####3. Of the four types of sources indicated by the 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggp <- ggplot(baltimore,aes(factor(year),Emissions,fill=type)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + theme_bw() + guides(fill=FALSE)+ facet_grid(.~type,scales = "free",space="free") + labs(x="year", y=expression("Total PM"[2.5]*" Emission (Tons)")) + labs(title=expression("PM"[2.5]*" Emissions, Baltimore City 1999-2008 by Source Type"))

print(ggp)
```

Of the four source types, all of them have decreased overall from 1999 to 2008. The clear downward trends on every year is in NonPoint and On-Road. Non-Road and Point both have increases in between 1999 to 2008.

#####4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?

First we subset coal combustion source factor:
```{r}
combustion <- grepl("comb", SCC$SCC.Level.One, ignore.case=TRUE)
coal <- grepl("coal", SCC$SCC.Level.Four, ignore.case=TRUE) 
coalcombustion <- (combustion & coal)
combustionSCC <- SCC[coalcombustion,]$SCC
combustionNEI <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% combustionSCC,]
```

Then, we plot:
```{r}
ggp <- ggplot(combustionNEI,aes(factor(year),Emissions/10^5)) + geom_bar(stat="identity",fill="grey",width=0.75) + theme_bw() +  guides(fill=FALSE) + labs(x="year", y=expression("Total PM"[2.5]*" Emission (10^5 Tons)")) + labs(title=expression("PM"[2.5]*" Coal Combustion Source Emissions Across US from 1999-2008"))

print(ggp)
```

Overall, coal combusion has decreased from 1999 to 2008. We do see a small increase between 2002 and 2005, but a following significant decrease anchors the overall trend.

#####5. How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?

First we subset the motor vehicles:
```{r}
vehicles <- grepl("vehicle", SCC$SCC.Level.Two, ignore.case=TRUE)
vehiclesSCC <- SCC[vehicles,]$SCC
vehiclesNEI <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% vehiclesSCC,]
```

Next we subset for motor vehicles in Baltimore,
```{r}
baltimoreVehiclesNEI <- subset(vehiclesNEI, fips == 24510)
```

Finally we plot using ggplot2,

```{r}
ggp <- ggplot(baltimoreVehiclesNEI,aes(factor(year),Emissions)) + geom_bar(stat="identity",fill="grey",width=0.75) + theme_bw() +  guides(fill=FALSE) + labs(x="year", y=expression("Total PM"[2.5]*" Emission (10^5 Tons)")) + labs(title=expression("PM"[2.5]*" Motor Vehicle Emissions in Baltimore from 1999 to 2008"))

print(ggp)
```

Motor Vehicle Source Emissions in Baltimore have decreased year over year from 1999 to 2008.

#####6. Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟶𝟼𝟶𝟹𝟽"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

Pull out Baltimore and LA data:
```{r}
vehiclesBaltimoreNEI <- subset(vehiclesNEI, fips = "24510")
vehiclesBaltimoreNEI$city <- "Baltimore City"
vehiclesLANEI <- subset(vehiclesNEI, fips == "06037")
vehiclesLANEI$city <- "Los Angeles County"
bothNEI <- rbind(vehiclesBaltimoreNEI,vehiclesLANEI)
```

Now we plot:

```{r}
ggp <- ggplot(bothNEI, aes(x=factor(year), y=Emissions, fill=city)) + geom_bar(aes(fill=year),stat="identity") + facet_grid(scales="free", space="free", .~city) + guides(fill=FALSE) + theme_bw() + labs(x="year", y=expression("Total PM"[2.5]*" Emission (Kilo-Tons)")) + labs(title=expression("PM"[2.5]*" Motor Vehicle Source Emissions in Baltimore & LA, 1999-2008"))

print(ggp)
```

LA has seen a greater decrease in motor vehicle emissions than Baltimore from 1999 to 2008.
